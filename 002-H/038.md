# Users who didn't own any nfts still can increase their community power

## Lines of code 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L607-L646

## Summary
There is no check if a user has 0 votes in the function `Governance.castVote()`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Users can use the function `castVote()` to vote for a specified proposal. For each time user make a vote, the value of `totalCommunityScoreData.votes` and `userCommunityScoreData[_voter]` will increase by 1.
```solidity=
function _castVote(address _voter, uint256 _proposalId, uint8 _support) internal returns (uint) {
    ...some_slice_of_code...;
   
    uint24 votes = (staking.getVotes(_voter)).toUint24();
    
    ...some_slice_of_code...;
    
     /// [$audit-high] what if votes = 0 --> votes = 0, but still increase community power 
    ++totalCommunityScoreData.votes;
    ++userCommunityScoreData[_voter].votes;

    return votes;
}
```
But for some users who didn't own any nfts, this value still increases. This will make the community power of that users increase even if they don't join the market.

## Impact
* User who didn't own any nfts can increase their community power for future use (if they buy a nft in the future)
* Moreover, this issue can make the value of `proposalThreshold` higher. This will make users harder to propose a new proposal. 
    * Similar issue with `quorumVotes`.

## Code Snippet
```solidity= 
function testVoteWithZeroVotingPower() public { 
    address alice = vm.addr(0xA11CE);
    assertEq(staking.getVotes(alice), 0); //alice's voting power = 0

    uint proposalId = _createAndVerifyProposal();
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + gov.votingDelay());
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(alice);
    gov.castVote(proposalId, 1);

    //alice's vote scores increased
    (uint256 votes, , ) = gov.userCommunityScoreData(alice);
    assertEq(votes, 1);
}
```
Put this test function into `test/governance/CastVote.t.sol`
and run it using
```bash= 
forge test -v --match-test testVoteWithZeroVotingPower -v
```
## Tool used
Foundry 

## Recommendation
Revert the transaction when the voting power of `msg.sender` is 0
