# Adversary can abuse delegating to lower quorum

## Summary

When a user delegates to another user they surrender their community voting power. The quorum threshold for a vote is determined when it is created. Users can artificially lower quorum by delegating to other users then creating a proposal. After it's created they can self delegate and regain all their community voting power to reach quorum easier. 

## Vulnerability Detail

    // If a user is delegating back to themselves, they regain their community voting power, so adjust totals up
    if (_delegator == _delegatee) {
      _updateTotalCommunityVotingPower(_delegator, true);

    // If a user delegates away their votes, they forfeit their community voting power, so adjust totals down
    } else if (currentDelegate == _delegator) {
      _updateTotalCommunityVotingPower(_delegator, false);
    }

When a user delegates to user other than themselves, they forfeit their community votes and lowers the total number of votes. When they self delegate again they will recover all their community voting power.

        newProposal.id = newProposalId.toUint96();
        newProposal.proposer = msg.sender;
        newProposal.targets = _targets;
        newProposal.values = _values;
        newProposal.signatures = _signatures;
        newProposal.calldatas = _calldatas;

        //@audit quorum votes locked at creation

        newProposal.quorumVotes = quorumVotes().toUint24();
        newProposal.startTime = (block.timestamp + votingDelay).toUint32();
        newProposal.endTime = (block.timestamp + votingDelay + votingPeriod).toUint32();

When a proposal is created the quorum is locked at the time at which it's created. Users can combine these two quirks to abuse the voting.

Example:

Assume there is 1000 total votes and quorum is 20%. Assume 5 users each have 35 votes, 10 base votes and 25 community votes. In this scenario quorum is 200 votes which they can't achieve. Each user delegates to other users, reducing each of their votes by 25 and reducing the total number of votes of 875. Now they can create a proposal and quorum will now be 175 votes (875*20%). They all self delegate and recover their community votes. Now they can reach quorum and pass their proposal.

## Impact

Users can collude to lower quorum and pass proposal easier

## Recommendation

One solution would be to add a vote cooldown to users after they delegate, long enough to make sure all active proposals have expired before they're able to vote. The other option would be to implement checkpoints.
