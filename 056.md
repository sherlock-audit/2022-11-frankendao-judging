# [Medium-1] Hardcoded `monsterMultiplier` in case of `stakedTimeBonus` disregards the updates done to  `monsterMultiplier` through `setMonsterMultiplier()`

## Summary
[Medium-1] Hardcoded monsterMultiplier in case of ``stakedTimeBonus`` disregards the updates done to  ``monsterMultiplier`` through ``setMonsterMultiplier()``

## Vulnerability Detail
FrankenDAO allows users to stake two types of NFTs, `Frankenpunks` and `Frankenmonsters` , one of which is considered more valuable, ie: `Frankenpunks`, 

This is achieved by reducing votes applicable for `Frankenmonsters` by `monsterMultiplier`.

```solidity
function getTokenVotingPower(uint _tokenId) public override view returns (uint) {
      if (ownerOf(_tokenId) == address(0)) revert NonExistentToken();

      // If tokenId < 10000, it's a FrankenPunk, so 100/100 = a multiplier of 1
      uint multiplier = _tokenId < 10_000 ? PERCENT : monsterMultiplier;
      
      // evilBonus will return 0 for all FrankenMonsters, as they are not eligible for the evil bonus
      return ((baseVotes * multiplier) / PERCENT) + stakedTimeBonus[_tokenId] + evilBonus(_tokenId);
    }
```

This `monsterMultiplier` is initially set as 50 and could be changed by governance proposal.

```solidity
function setMonsterMultiplier(uint _monsterMultiplier) external onlyExecutor {
    emit MonsterMultiplierChanged(monsterMultiplier = _monsterMultiplier); 
  }
```

However, one piece of code inside the FrakenDAO staking contract doesn't consider this and has a monster multiplier hardcoded.

```solidity
function stake(uint[] calldata _tokenIds, uint _unlockTime) 
----
function _stakeToken(uint _tokenId, uint _unlockTime) internal returns (uint) {
   if (_unlockTime > 0) {
     --------
      stakedTimeBonus[_tokenId] = _tokenId < 10000 ? **fullStakedTimeBonus : fullStakedTimeBonus / 2;** 
    }
--------
```

Hence any update done to `monsterMultiplier` would not reflect in the calculation of `stakedTimeBonus`, and thereby votes.

## Impact : Medium
Any update done to monsterMultiplier would not be reflected in stakedTimeBonus; it would always remain as /2 or 50%.

## Likelihood: Medium
One needs to pass a governance proposal to change the monster multiplier, so this is definitely not a high likelihood; it's not low as well, as there is a clear provision in spec regarding this.
