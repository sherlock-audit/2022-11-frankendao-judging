# Staking.stake should add the minVotingPower parameter

## Summary
The VotingPower that the user gets when calling Staking.stake will be affected by some state variables
## Vulnerability Detail
The VotingPower that the user gets when calling Staking.stake will be affected by the state variables like monsterMultiplier/baseVotes/maxStakeBonusTime/maxStakeBonusAmount. 
These variables can be set by the Executor and may frontrun the user's stake.
So minVotingPower should be added to the Staking.stake to avoid the user getting too small VotingPower
## Impact
These variables can be set by the Executor and may frontrun the user's stake.
