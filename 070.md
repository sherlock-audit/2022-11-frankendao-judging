# `Staking.unstake()` doesn't decrease the original voting power that was used in `Staking.stake()`.

## Summary
`Staking.unstake()` doesn't decrease the original voting power that was used in `Staking.stake()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
When users stake/unstake the underlying NFTs, it calculates the token voting power using [getTokenVotingPower()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L507-L515) and increases/decreases their voting power accordingly.

```solidity
    function getTokenVotingPower(uint _tokenId) public override view returns (uint) {
      if (ownerOf(_tokenId) == address(0)) revert NonExistentToken();

      // If tokenId < 10000, it's a FrankenPunk, so 100/100 = a multiplier of 1
      uint multiplier = _tokenId < 10_000 ? PERCENT : monsterMultiplier;
      
      // evilBonus will return 0 for all FrankenMonsters, as they are not eligible for the evil bonus
      return ((baseVotes * multiplier) / PERCENT) + stakedTimeBonus[_tokenId] + evilBonus(_tokenId);
    }
```

But `getTokenVotingPower()` uses some parameters like `monsterMultiplier` and `baseVotes` and the output would be changed for the same `tokenId` after the admin changed these settings.

Currently, `_stake()` and `_unstake()` calculates the token voting power independently and the below scenario would be possible.

- At the first time, `baseVotes = 20, monsterMultiplier = 50`.
- A user staked a `FrankenMonsters` and his voting power = 10 [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L369-L371).
- After that, the admin changed `monsterMultiplier = 60`.
- When a user tries to unstake the NFT, the token voting power will be `20 * 60 / 100 = 12` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L514).
- So it will revert with uint underflow [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L436).
- After all, he can't unstake the NFT.

## Impact
`votesFromOwnedTokens` might be updated wrongly or users can't unstake for the worst case because it doesn't decrease the same token voting power while unstaking.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I think we should add a mapping like `tokenVotingPower` to save an original token voting power when users stake the token and decrease the same amount when they unstake.
