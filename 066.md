# [Tomo-M4] Use safeTransferFrom instead of transferFrom for ERC721

## Summary

Use safeTransferFrom instead of transferFrom for ERC721

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_to` address will be transferred collateral NFT when `_unstakeToken()` is called. 

However, if `_to` address is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in the contract.

As per the documentation of EIP-721:

> A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.
>

As per the documentation of IERC721.sol by Openzeppelin

Ref: [https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol#L81-L97](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol#L81-L97)

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`.
 *
 * WARNING: Note that the caller is responsible to confirm that the recipient is capable of receiving ERC721
 * or else they may be permanently lost. Usage of {safeTransferFrom} prevents loss, though the caller must
 * understand this adds an external call which potentially creates a reentrancy vulnerability.
 *
 * Requirements:
 *
 * - `from` cannot be the zero address.
 * - `to` cannot be the zero address.
 * - `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`.
 * - If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}.
 *
 * Emits a {Transfer} event.

```

## Impact

Users possibly lose their NFTs

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L477
``` solidity
    collection.transferFrom(address(this), _to, _tokenId);
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `safeTransferFrom` instead of `transferFrom` to check received address support for ERC721 implementation.
