# Staking#_unstake removes votes from wrong person if msg.sender != owner

## Summary

Staking#_unstake allows any msg.sender to unstake tokens for any owner that has approved them. The issue is that even when msg.sender != owner the votes are removed from msg.sender instead of owner. The result is that the owner keeps their votes and msg.sender loses theirs. This could be abused to hijack or damage voting.

## Vulnerability Detail

    address owner = ownerOf(_tokenId);
    if (msg.sender != owner && !isApprovedForAll[owner][msg.sender] && msg.sender != getApproved[_tokenId]) revert NotAuthorized();

Staking#_unstake allows any msg.sender to unstake tokens for any owner that has approved them.

    uint lostVotingPower;
    for (uint i = 0; i < numTokens; i++) {
        lostVotingPower += _unstakeToken(_tokenIds[i], _to);
    }

    votesFromOwnedTokens[msg.sender] -= lostVotingPower;
    // Since the delegate currently has the voting power, it must be removed from their balance
    // If the user doesn't delegate, delegates(msg.sender) will return self
    tokenVotingPower[getDelegate(msg.sender)] -= lostVotingPower;
    totalTokenVotingPower -= lostVotingPower;

After looping through _unstakeToken all accumulated votes are removed from msg.sender. The problem with this is that msg.sender is allowed to unstake tokens for users other than themselves and in these cases they will lose votes rather than the user who owns the token.

Example:
User A and User B both stake tokens and have 10 votes each. User A approves User B to unstake their tokens. User B calls unstake for User A. User B is msg.sender and User A is owner. The votes should be removed from owner but instead are removed from msg.sender. The result is that after unstaking User B has a vote balance of 0 while still having their locked token and User B has a vote balance of 10 and their token back. Now User B is unable to unstake their token because their votes will underflow on unstake, permanently trapping their NFT.

## Impact

Votes are removed incorrectly if msg.sender != owner. By extension this would forever trap msg.sender tokens in the contract.
