# low `TotalVotingPower` can have `proposalThreshold()` and `quorum()` return zero

## Summary

When `TotalVotingPower` is low, `proposalThreshold()` and `quorumVotes()` can round down to 0.


## Vulnerability Detail

During early stage of the system, the `TotalVotingPower` is low, and in `bps2Uint()`, `(_number * _bps) / 10000` could round down to 0, and return 0 for `proposalThreshold()` and `quorumVotes()`.

If `proposalThreshold()` is 0, anyone can `propose()` even without any staking. Since the following if check can pass.

```solidity
        if (staking.getVotes(msg.sender) < votesNeededToPropose) revert NotEligible();
```


If `quorumVotes()` is 0, it is possible that 1 vote can make a proposal succeed. Or just 1 more yes vote than against vote.


## Impact

In early stage when the `TotalVotingPower` is low:
- anyone could propose, the `proposalThreshold` will fail to filter qualification.
- the `quorumVotes` requirement could fail to function, since the `quorumVotes()` may round to 0. And only 1 vote could get the proposal succeed. Or just 1 more yes vote than against vote.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- add minimum value check for `proposalThreshold()` and `quorumVotes()`.
- round up when `TotalVotingPower` is low
