# It is risky to set refund gas and fee as constants

## Summary
It has risk of being arbitraged to set refund gas and fee as constants in cases that Ethereum updates a new version with different gas fee, the team changes the refund strategy, or etc. This can refer to an existing vulnerability and exploit on ethereum-alarm-clock project.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `src/utils/Refundable.sol`, refund gas and fee are set to be constants by
`uint256 public constant MAX_REFUND_PRIORITY_FEE = 2 gwei`
`uint256 public constant REFUND_BASE_GAS = 27_000`
It is fine running on current Ethereum mainet. But constants cannot deal with the gas change  in cases, like Ethereum version updated, advanced layer-2 technique adopted, or the refund strategy changed. It is better to write an onlyowner function to let the owner can change refund gas and fee.

The existing exploit case can refer to the transaction
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4a84d0872887f91546cd5400cf99763b654975efb3376ee55e4463bcfbca4e97
and the function `cancel` refunds users
https://github.com/ethereum-alarm-clock/ethereum-alarm-clock/blob/master/contracts/Library/RequestLib.sol#L458-L510
The hacker does not need to use more than 85000 gas, only 70355 is enough, the actual tx fee paid < the Transaction Fee returned by the cancel function, where the difference is the hacker profit. At last, the hacker got 60+ ether profit.

## Impact
Refund gas and fee are set to be constants cannot deal with possbile changes in future.

## Recommendation
Write an onlyowner function to let the owner can change refund gas and fee, so as to deal with possbile changes in future.
