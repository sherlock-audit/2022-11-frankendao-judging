# `getCommunityVotingPower` doesn't calculate voting Power correctly due to precision loss

## Summary

In `Staking.sol`, the [getCommunityVotingPower](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L520) function, doesn't calculate the votes correctly due to precision loss. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In [getCommunityVotingPower](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L520) function, the `return` statement is where the mistake lies in:

```solidity
	return 
        (votes * cpMultipliers.votes / PERCENT) + 
        (proposalsCreated * cpMultipliers.proposalsCreated / PERCENT) + 
        (proposalsPassed * cpMultipliers.proposalsPassed / PERCENT);
```

Here, after each multiplication by the `Multipliers`, we immediately divide it by `PERCENT`. Every time we do a division, there is a certain amount of precision loss. And when its done thrice, the loss just accumulates. So instead, the division by `PERCENT` should be done after all 3 terms are added together. 

Note that this loss is not there, if the `Multipliers` are a multiple of `PERCENT`. But these values can be changed through governance later. So its better to be careful assuming that they may not always be a multiple of `PERCENT`.

## Impact

The community voting power of the user is calculated wrongly.

## Code Snippet
The `getCommunityVotingPower` function:

```solidity
    function getCommunityVotingPower(address _voter) public override view returns (uint) {
      uint64 votes;
      uint64 proposalsCreated;
      uint64 proposalsPassed;
      
      // We allow this function to be called with the max uint value to get the total community voting power
      if (_voter == address(type(uint160).max)) {
        (votes, proposalsCreated, proposalsPassed) = governance.totalCommunityScoreData();
      } else {
        // This is only the case if they are delegated or unstaked, both of which should zero out the result
        if (tokenVotingPower[_voter] == 0) return 0;

        (votes, proposalsCreated, proposalsPassed) = governance.userCommunityScoreData(_voter);
      }

      CommunityPowerMultipliers memory cpMultipliers = communityPowerMultipliers;

      return 
        (votes * cpMultipliers.votes / PERCENT) + 
        (proposalsCreated * cpMultipliers.proposalsCreated / PERCENT) + 
        (proposalsPassed * cpMultipliers.proposalsPassed / PERCENT);
    }
```

VSCode, Manual Analysis

## Recommendation

Do the division once after all terms are added together:

```solidity
      return 
        ( (votes * cpMultipliers.votes) + 
        (proposalsCreated * cpMultipliers.proposalsCreated) + 
        (proposalsPassed * cpMultipliers.proposalsPassed) ) / PERCENT;
    }
```
