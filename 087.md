# [Medium-2] Lack of a snapshot on configuration parameters for ``communityPowerMultipliers`` can leave proposal votes in an incorrect state.

## Summary
The lack of a snapshot on configuration parameters for ``communityPowerMultipliers`` can leave proposal votes in an incorrect state.

## Vulnerability Detail
FrakenDAO has various configurable parameters inside the staking contract.

Some of these are - 
1. **baseVotes**
2. **communityPowerMultipliers**
    1. **votes**
    2. **proposalsCreated**
    3. **proposalsPassed**
3. monsterMultiplier

All of these impact usersâ€™ votes in one way or another.
Whenever a proposal is created a snapshot of the quorum value is taken. 
Which is calculated on the basis of the current total voting power.
```solidity
function quorumVotes() public view returns (uint256) {
        return bps2Uint(quorumVotesBPS, staking.getTotalVotingPower());
    }
```

Now, what if a proposal is created and one of the parameters from above is changed?
If baseVotes is changed, it doesn't matter since the snapshot already exists in `tokenVotingPower`. 
But if `communityPowerMultipliers` is increased for some parameter, a quorum would be reached when it shouldn't, and if it is decreased, a quorum would not reach when it should.

## Impact: Medium 
A quorum could be reached when it shouldn't, and if it is decreased, a quorum could not reach when it should.

## Likelihood: Low
Needs certain circumstances to occur.

## Recommendation
Consider snapshotting community voting power as well.
