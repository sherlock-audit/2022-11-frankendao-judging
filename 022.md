# Proposals with identical transactions will result in denial of service

## Summary

Proposals that contain identical transactions (`target`, `value`, `signature`, `data` values) cannot be executed due to the timelock contract not allowing queueing of duplicate transactions. As a result, such a proposal will always revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

Proposals that contain identical transactions (`target`, `value`, `signature`, `data` values) cannot be executed due to the timelock contract not allowing queueing of duplicate transactions. As a result, such a proposal will always revert.

When a transaction is queued in the timelock contract, its hash is passed as the unique identifier of the transaction:

The hash includes the following parameters: `target`, `value`, `signature`, `data`, and `eta`. It's possible that one proposal needs to execute multiple identical transactions, and all of them will have the same hash because all the parameters will be identical.

## Impact

Proposals with identical transactions will result in denial of service

## Recommendation

In case this is an expected behavior, consider disallowing creating proposals with identical transactions. Otherwise, consider adding an extra parameter that will uniquely identify each transaction.
