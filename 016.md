# No snapshot of the votes, which can mess up the votes

## Summary
No snapshot of votes, a user can delegate to other users to vote again after voting
## Vulnerability Detail
In Staking._delegate, there is no snapshot of the user's votes based on the timestamp, and in Governance._castVote, the user's latest vote is always used to count the votes, which allows a user can delegate to other users to vote again after voting.
## Impact
A user can delegate to other users to vote again after voting
