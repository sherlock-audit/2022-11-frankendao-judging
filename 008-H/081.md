# propose and cancelling can be done repeatedly to drain DAO fund to 0

## Summary
A proposer, once having more voting power than the proposalThreshold(), can repeatedly `propose` and `cancel` with gas refund on propose(). Multiple accounts can also be setup to vote on the proposal cycle with gas refund. Doing so repeatedly will drain the DAO fund.

## Vulnerability Detail
proposalRefund is set to True in constructor of Governance, a proposer can claim gas refund 

```solidity

        // Refunds gas if proposalRefund is true
        if (proposalRefund) {
            uint256 startGas = gasleft();
            proposalId = _propose(_targets, _values, _signatures, _calldatas, _description);
            _refundGas(startGas);
        } else {

```
same for votingRefund, voters can claim gas refund from DAO.

```solidity
        // Refunds gas if votingRefund is true
        if (votingRefund) {
            uint256 startGas = gasleft();
            uint votes = _castVote(msg.sender, _proposalId, _support);
            emit VoteCast( msg.sender, _proposalId, _support, votes);
            _refundGas(startGas);
        } else {

```

Immediately after that, proposer can cancel it. State will be pending and thus can be cancelled.

```solidity

    function cancel(uint256 _proposalId) external cancelable(_proposalId) {
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[_proposalId];

        // Proposals can be canceled if proposer themselves decide to cancel the proposal (at any time before execution)
        // Nouns allows anyone to cancel if proposer falls below threshold, but because tokens are locked, this isn't possible
        if (msg.sender != proposal.proposer) revert NotEligible();

        // If the proposal is queued or executed, remove it from the Executor's queuedTransactions mapping
        // Otherwise, remove it from the Active Proposals array
        _removeTransactionWithQueuedOrExpiredCheck(proposal);

        // Set the canceled flag to true to change the status to Canceled
        proposal.canceled = true;   

        emit ProposalCanceled(_proposalId);
    }

```
Repeat process till DAO fund is drained to 0.

## Impact
Proposer can create and cancel and create without a time gap repeatedly, enabling proposals to be created, voted on by a group of accounts and cancelled repeatedly with gas refunds occurring on castVote and propose, eventually draining the DAO fund to 0.

## Recommendation
Introduce a Propose Cooldown where user can only propose when `prevProposeTime + proposeCooldown  < block.timestamp`
