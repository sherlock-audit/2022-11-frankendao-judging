# Should decrease the community power of proposer when his/her proposal is vetoed/canceled

## Summary
When a proposal is vetoed, the proposer of that proposal can still increase his/her community power. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When a proposal is created/queued, the corresponding community power of the proposer (proposalsCreated / proposalsPassed) is increased by 1. 
In some rare cases when a proposal has malicious behavior, the proposal will be vetoed by the admins. 
```solidity=
// url = https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L520-L534

/// @notice Vetoes a proposal 
/// @param _proposalId The id of the proposal to veto
/// @dev This allows the founder or council multisig to veto a malicious proposal
function veto(uint256 _proposalId) external cancelable(_proposalId) onlyAdmins {
    Proposal storage proposal = proposals[_proposalId];


    // If the proposal is queued or executed, remove it from the Executor's queuedTransactions mapping
    // Otherwise, remove it from the Active Proposals array
    _removeTransactionWithQueuedOrExpiredCheck(proposal);


    // Update the vetoed flag so the proposal's state is Vetoed
    proposal.vetoed = true;


    emit ProposalVetoed(_proposalId);
}
```
But even when a proposal is vetoed, the community power of that malicious proposer is still increased. It will support him/her in the future malicious proposal. 

The same issue happens in the function `Governance.cancel()`. 

## Impact
Malicious proposer has more power even when (s)he creates a malicious proposal
