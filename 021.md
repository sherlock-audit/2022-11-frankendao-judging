# Calling `setMonsterMultiplier()` In `Staking.sol` After Users Stake Monsters Will Cause Tokens To Be Locked And Voting To Be Manipulated

## Summary
Calling `setMonsterMultiplier()` In `Staking.sol` After Users Stake Monsters Will Cause Tokens To Be Locked And Voting To Be Manipulated
## Vulnerability Detail
In `Staking.sol`, the `setMonsterMultiplier()` function is defined to allow the Executor to change the value based on a governance proposal.
Setting the `monsterMultiplier` any time after a single user has staked their `monster` will cause tokens to be lost temporarily, and unhandled un-deserved voting power.
## Code Snippet

## Impact
If the `monsterMultiplier` is increased from the base `50%` specified in the `constructor()`, it will cause the entire staking contract to brick all staked monsters from being `unstaked`. This is because at the time of staking, the `tokenVotingPower[getDelegate(msg.sender)]` and `votesFromOwnedTokens[msg.sender]` are set to the voting power _AT THE TIME OF EXECUTION_. 
### First,
A user performs a basic stake on their monster.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L356-L384
Then, when going to un-stake the monster after the voting power has been increased, the user who is staked calls the `unstake()` function.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L427-L458
In the function, the `tokenVotingPower[getDelegate(msg.sender)]` and `votesFromOwnedTokens[msg.sender]` are once again being referenced. This time, the _new_ voting power is being deducted from the _old_. In the case that it is higher, it will always revert due to underflow and the monster will be lost until the `monsterMultiplier` is decreased to <= the old value.
### Second,
If the multiplier were to be lowered after a user has staked, there is another issue as well. Lets say again a user stakes their monster, but this time the `monsterMultiplier` is lowered.
when the `tokenVotingPower[getDelegate(msg.sender)]` and `votesFromOwnedTokens[msg.sender]` are deducted this time, there still is voting power left over even though the user un-staked, causing users to have undeserved voting rights.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the ability to manipulate the `monsterMultiplier` after deployment.
