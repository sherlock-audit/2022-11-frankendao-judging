# Users's nft can be locked because of the wrong implementation of function `Staking.delegate()`

## Summary
The implementation of function `Staking._delegate()` forget to: 
* increase the total community power if `tokenVotingPower[_delegatee] == amount`
* decrease the total community power if `tokenVotingPower[currentDelegate] == 0`

## Vulnerability Detail
Following the logic of function `Staking.stake()`, the total community power will be increased when the delegate of `msg.sender` had no `tokenVoting` before. 
```solidity=
// url = https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L375-L383
function _stake(uint[] calldata _tokenIds, uint _unlockTime) internal {
    ...some_slice_of_codes...;

    // If the user had no tokenVotingPower before and doesn't delegate, they just unlocked their community voting power
    // If their tokenVotingPower == newVotingPower, that means (a) it was 0 before and (b) they don't delegate, 
    //                                                                                    or it'd be 0 now
    if (tokenVotingPower[msg.sender] == newVotingPower) {
      // The user's community voting power is reactivated, so we add it to the total community voting power
      _updateTotalCommunityVotingPower(msg.sender, true);
    
    // If their delegate had no tokenVotingPower before, then they just unlocked their community voting power
    } else if (tokenVotingPower[getDelegate(msg.sender)] == newVotingPower) {
      // The delegate's community voting power is reactivated, so we add it to the total community voting power
      _updateTotalCommunityVotingPower(getDelegate(msg.sender), true);
    }
}
```
Function `Staking.delegate()` should have the same logic as above when user A delegates to user B who had no voting power before, it should unlock the community power of B either. 

In the same sense, function `Staking.delegate()` should lock the voting power when tokenVotingPower of V reaches 0. 

This missing update can lead to a bad scenario which I will describe later by example in **Code Snippet section** 

## Impact
* Wrong calculation of voting power 
* User's nft will be locked

You can place this file into `/test` folder and run it using: 
```bash= 
forge test -v --match-test testDelegateIssue -v
```
Script explanation:
1. Alice, Bob, and Charlie stake their Franken NFTs.
2. Alice creates a proposal and votes for it. Bob voted for it too. Then Alice and Bob have the same community vote score (equal 1) and total community vote score = 2.
3. Alice's proposal was vetoed then Bob unstake his Franken token (Bob can do it because the proposal has not been active anymore). Then total community vote was updated to 1 (subtracted from Bob's).
4. Charlie delegate voting power to Bob, it will not add Bob's vote score to total community vote score. Then total community vote score still is 1 (because Charlie's vote score = 0).
5. Charlie unstake his Franken token, total community vote score will be updated to 0 (subtracted from Bob's vote score) because it made Bob's voting power decrease to 0.
6. Alice can not unstake her Franken token because it will revert with underflow bug (when subtracting the total community vote score from Alice's vote score).

## Tool used
Foundry 

## Recommendation
Should call `_updateTotalCommunityVotingPower` when delegate and undelegate if voting power of`delegatee` update to 0 or update from 0.
