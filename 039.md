## Summary
There is no upper bound for the staking duration of an nft. It will let a user stake nft with a pretty high unlock time to get a high voting power. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `stake()` in contract `Staking.sol` let users stake an array of `tokenIds` with arbitrary `unlockTime`
```solidity=
// url = https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L341-L351
  function stake(uint[] calldata _tokenIds, uint _unlockTime) public {
    // Refunds gas if stakingRefund is true and hasn't been used by this user in the past 24 hours
    if (stakingRefund && lastStakingRefund[msg.sender] + refundCooldown <= block.timestamp) {
      uint256 startGas = gasleft();
      _stake(_tokenIds, _unlockTime);
      lastStakingRefund[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
      _refundGas(startGas);
    } else {
      _stake(_tokenIds, _unlockTime);
    }
  }
```
Since the `unlockTime` also affects the calculation of voting power through the value of `stakedTimeBonus`
```solidity=
// url = https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L389-L394
function _stakeToken(uint _tokenId, uint _unlockTime) internal returns (uint) {
    if (_unlockTime > 0) {
      unlockTime[_tokenId] = _unlockTime;
      uint fullStakedTimeBonus = ((_unlockTime - block.timestamp) * stakingSettings.maxStakeBonusAmount) / stakingSettings.maxStakeBonusTime;
      stakedTimeBonus[_tokenId] = _tokenId < 10000 ? fullStakedTimeBonus : fullStakedTimeBonus / 2;
    }
    ... 
}

// url = https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L507-L515
function getTokenVotingPower(uint _tokenId) public override view returns (uint) {
  if (ownerOf(_tokenId) == address(0)) revert NonExistentToken();


  // If tokenId < 10000, it's a FrankenPunk, so 100/100 = a multiplier of 1
  uint multiplier = _tokenId < 10_000 ? PERCENT : monsterMultiplier;

  // evilBonus will return 0 for all FrankenMonsters, as they are not eligible for the evil bonus
  return ((baseVotes * multiplier) / PERCENT) + stakedTimeBonus[_tokenId] + evilBonus(_tokenId);
}
```
So the higher `unlockTime` a user set, the more power in voting they gain. For some users who didn't look for the benefit of nft, they can set the value of `unlockTime = HIGH_VALUE`, to get a lot of power to vote in the governance. 

Moreover, in contract `Governance.sol`, when someone call `propose`, function `_propose` will check that sender has enough voting power to propose or not (not smaller than `proposalThreshold`)
```solidity=
/// *** Governance.sol ***  
// url = https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L364-L373
function _propose(
        address[] memory _targets,
        uint256[] memory _values,
        string[] memory _signatures,
        bytes[] memory _calldatas,
        string memory _description
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        // Confirm the proposer meets the proposalThreshold
        uint votesNeededToPropose = proposalThreshold();
        if (staking.getVotes(msg.sender) < votesNeededToPropose) revert NotEligible();
```
And `proposalThreshold` is calculated by total voting power which is too large because of above staking:
```solidity= 
// url = https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L316-L318
function proposalThreshold() public view returns (uint256) {
    return bps2Uint(proposalThresholdBPS, staking.getTotalVotingPower());
}
```
So a malicious user just needs to specify a big value of `unlockTime` to break the functionality of the Governance contract when it tries to create a proposal. 
(In case a malicious user try to create a proposal, (s)he can't, cause the value of `quorumVotes` is capped in `uint24`)

## Impact
* Users can have a large amount of voting power 
* Prevent users from creating a proposal

## Recommendation
Provide a new variable to limit `unlockTime` when a user wants to stake their nfts.
