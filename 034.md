# Setter/Delegate functions are missing paused check

## Summary

In the Staking contract, the setter/delegation functions are missing **paused** modifier.  In case a hack is occuring or an exploit is discovered, the team (or validators in this case) should be able to pause functionality until the necessary changes are made to the system.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the Staking contract, the setter/delegation functions are missing **paused** modifier.  In case a hack is occuring or an exploit is discovered, the team (or validators in this case) should be able to pause functionality until the necessary changes are made to the system.

## Impact

When the proposal or staking variables are changed, the changes can directly affect protocol behaviour. From that reason, consider implementing paused check on the setter and delegation functions.
