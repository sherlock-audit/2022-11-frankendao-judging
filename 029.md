# Adversary can burn huge amounts of treasury funds by creating a proposal with excessively large description string

## Summary

When creating a proposal, the proposer is allowed to specify a description string. This string is emitted when the proposal is created using up gas. When proposalRefund is true, the user is refunded for the entire cost of proposing. A malicious users could propose with an excessively large string to burn a large amount of the treasury funds

## Vulnerability Detail

        latestProposalIds[newProposal.proposer] = newProposalId;
        activeProposals.push(newProposalId);

        emit ProposalCreated(
            newProposalId,
            msg.sender,
            _targets,
            _values,
            _signatures,
            _calldatas,
            newProposal.startTime,
            newProposal.endTime,
            newProposal.quorumVotes,
            _description
        );

        return newProposalId;

At the end of Governance#_propose, the description string provided by the user is emitted. Since a string is of arbitrary length a user can specify a string of whatever length they wish. The longer the string the more gas required to emit it. A user could purposely input an excessively long string to cost the contract a huge amount of gas since they refund the entire amount of gas used to create the proposal. 

## Impact

Treasury funds are maliciously used, which may result in the vault running out of funds
