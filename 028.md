# Governance#queue increments the wrong counter when proposal is passed

## Summary

When a proposal is passed, it should increment proposalsPassed but instead it increments proposalsCreated. The result is that community voting is not tracked correctly and users don't receive the correct voting power for passed proposals.

## Vulnerability Detail

        // If a proposal is queued, we are ready to award the community voting power bonuses to the proposer
        ++userCommunityScoreData[proposal.proposer].proposalsCreated;
        
        // We don't need to check whether the proposer is accruing community voting power because
        // they needed that voting power to propose, and once they have an Active Proposal, their
        // tokens are locked from delegating and unstaking.
        ++totalCommunityScoreData.proposalsCreated;

In Governance#queue the users is awarded community points for successfully passing a proposal. The function should increment proposalsPassed but instead increments proposalsCreated. Proposals passed grant the user more voting than creating a proposal and since it increments the wrong variable the user is not awarded their full community vote.

## Impact

Users do not gain votes properly for passing proposals

## Recommendation

Increment proposalsPassed instead of proposalsCreated:

        // If a proposal is queued, we are ready to award the community voting power bonuses to the proposer
    -   ++userCommunityScoreData[proposal.proposer].proposalsCreated;
    +   ++userCommunityScoreData[proposal.proposer].proposalsPassed;
        
        // We don't need to check whether the proposer is accruing community voting power because
        // they needed that voting power to propose, and once they have an Active Proposal, their
        // tokens are locked from delegating and unstaking.
    -   ++totalCommunityScoreData.proposalsCreated;
    +   ++totalCommunityScoreData.proposalsPassed;
