# Staking#setBaseVotes and setMonsterMulitiplier are dangerous and will likely cause huge damage to voting

## Summary

Staking#setBaseVotes and setMonsterMulitiplier allows governance to adjust the base votes and multiplier applied when staking NFTs. The issue is that these votes are only updated when staking and unstaking. Raising or lowering this while there are active stakers will cause huge damage to voting. If it is raised then users will not be able to unstake because their vote count will underflow during unstaking. If it is lowered then unstaking a token won't remove the correct number of votes.

## Vulnerability Detail

    function getTokenVotingPower(uint _tokenId) public override view returns (uint) {
      if (ownerOf(_tokenId) == address(0)) revert NonExistentToken();

      // If tokenId < 10000, it's a FrankenPunk, so 100/100 = a multiplier of 1
      uint multiplier = _tokenId < 10_000 ? PERCENT : monsterMultiplier;
      
      // evilBonus will return 0 for all FrankenMonsters, as they are not eligible for the evil bonus
      return ((baseVotes * multiplier) / PERCENT) + stakedTimeBonus[_tokenId] + evilBonus(_tokenId);
    }

When unstaking the contract uses the current value for baseVotes and monsterMultiplier to detemine the number of votes to remove from both the user and the total number of votes. Staking#setBaseVotes and setMonsterMulitiplier allows these values to be changed while users are staked. Any adjustment will lead to serious and irreversible damage to the voting system.

Example:
Assume baseVotes is 10. At a certain time a user stakes their token, adding 10 votes to their total. Now baseVotes is changed to 20. When trying to unstake the contract will attempt to remove 20 votes from the users balance. This will underflow and revert which completely breaks unstaking. Now baseVotes is changed to 5. When the user unstakes it will only remove 5 votes from the user and they will still have 5 votes left even though they don't have any tokens stake.

A similar scenario would happen if monsterMultiplier was adjusted.

## Impact

Voting system will become completely broken if either function is ever used

## Recommendation

It will take a considerable amount of time and effort to make these functions work. Staking#setBaseVotes and setMonsterMulitiplier should be removed.
