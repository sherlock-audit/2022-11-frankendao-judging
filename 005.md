# Tokens can be locked slightly longer than expected

## Summary
In the `Staking` contract, it is expected that while users have active votes or proposals are open, their tokens will be locked. This is implemented via the `lockedWhileVotesCast` modifier. The modifier, queries the governance's,  active proposals array as shown here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L166-L174. 
However, in the `governance` contract there are instances where not active proposals are in the `ActiveProposals` array and need to be cleared. This is done via the `clear` function in the governance contract as shown here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L555-L581

As a result, during the period `P` where proposals are not active as stipulated in the `clear` function, and the actual moment when the proposals are cleared `C` via the `clear ()` function the tokens would still be locked. As such, the user's tokens would still be unfairly locked between  the duration `C -P`. 
## Vulnerability Detail
`ActiveProposals` are used by the `Staking` contract to determine when a user's token is locked which prevents delegation and staking of tokens. This is enforced by the `lockedWhileVotesCast` modifier. This `ActiveProposals` array is implemented in the `Governance` contract to track active proposals. As such, the `Governance` contract has a `clear ()` function to clear proposals which are no longer active but are still in the `ActiveProposals` array. Such proposals are highlighted in the `clear ()` function's comments.
Therefore, anyone can call this function with a `proposalID` to remove the proposal from this array. 
However, the `Staking` contract checks the `ActiveProposals` array without accounting for this possibility. As such, until such proposals are removed from the array via the `clear ()` function, the tokens would still be locked. 
It is worth noting that anyone can call the clear function at any time. 
## Impact
Tokens can be locked in the contract slightly longer which would prevent token delegation and staking.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Consider, stipulating this phenomenon in the Staking Contract such that users would know and can initiate the `clear` function themselves.
2. Automatically clear such proposals.
