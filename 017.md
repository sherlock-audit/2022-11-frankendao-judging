# Governance.queue should increase proposalsPassed instead of proposalsCreated

## Summary
Governance.queue should increase proposalsPassed instead of proposalsCreated
## Vulnerability Detail
In both Governance.verifyProposal and Governance.queue, proposalsCreated is increased.
It is correct to increase proposalsCreated in Governance.verifyProposal and proposalsPassed in Governance.queue. 
Although currently communityPowerMultipliers.proposalsCreated == communityPowerMultipliers.proposalsPassed, if setProposalsCreatedMultiplier/setProposalsPassedMultiplier is called, this will cause the bonus votes to be calculated incorrectly

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change to
```diff
    function queue(uint256 _proposalId) external {
        // Succeeded means we're past the endTime, yes votes outweigh no votes, and quorum threshold is met
        if(state(_proposalId) != ProposalState.Succeeded) revert InvalidStatus();
        
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[_proposalId];

        // Set the ETA (time for execution) to the soonest time based on the Executor's delay
        uint256 eta = block.timestamp + executor.DELAY();
        proposal.eta = eta.toUint32();

        // Queue separate transactions for each action in the proposal
        uint numTargets = proposal.targets.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < numTargets; i++) {
            executor.queueTransaction(proposal.targets[i], proposal.values[i], proposal.signatures[i], proposal.calldatas[i], eta);
        }

        // If a proposal is queued, we are ready to award the community voting power bonuses to the proposer
-       ++userCommunityScoreData[proposal.proposer].proposalsCreated;
+       ++userCommunityScoreData[proposal.proposer].proposalsPassed;
        
        // We don't need to check whether the proposer is accruing community voting power because
        // they needed that voting power to propose, and once they have an Active Proposal, their
        // tokens are locked from delegating and unstaking.
-       ++totalCommunityScoreData.proposalsCreated;
+       ++totalCommunityScoreData.proposalsPassed;
