# Proposal created on start of staking can get quorum more easily

## Summary
Proposal created on start of staking can get quorum more easily.
## Vulnerability Detail
When new proposal is created then quorom amount is [set](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L413) to proposal data.
Then when voting has ended it's checked if quorum votes [were casted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L293). If yes, and for votes were more than against, then proposal succeed.

This is how quorum amount is calculated.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L322-L324
```solidity
    function quorumVotes() public view returns (uint256) {
        return bps2Uint(quorumVotesBPS, staking.getTotalVotingPower());
    }
```

As you can see it dependes of staking.getTotalVotingPower().
But staking.getTotalVotingPower() is always changing.

In some cases as in the beginning of staking it can be more easily to get a quorum.

Example.
1.Staking just began and attacker stake his tokens. He received 100 votes.
2.There is not so much stakers yet, so total amount of votes is 1000.
3.Attacker creates proposal. Suppose that quorum is 20% and quorum votes amount is calculated as 200.
4.New stakers are coming and total votes amount is 100 000. And all of them can vote.
5.As a result it's more easy for attacker to get quorum now as it's not 20% now, it's only 0.5%.

## Recommendation
Maybe you can consider pass not exact votes as quorum, but a percentage. So it will be more dynamic and every time you just need to have some percentage of total votes to get quorum.
