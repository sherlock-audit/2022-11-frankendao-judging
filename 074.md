# [Tomo-M6] Attackers can increase voting power by incentivizing

## Summary

Attackers can increase voting power by incentivizing 

## Vulnerability Detail

There are a lot of cases of used bribes and incentives, governance to skewed to act against the interest of the founders

This is a good example of this issue

It is true that a properly aligned Vetoer will be able to prevent most of these attacks.

However, if attackers get a lot of votes, it is possible to vote not to let all proposals be executed, and the real governance system collapses

## Impact

The proposal decision depends on the attacker

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement the following to solve this problem

- For a certain period of time, the return value of `getVote()` and `getCommunityVotingPower()` would be zero for the blacklist accounts.
- For a certain period of time, the transaction of `stake()` and `delegate()` would return revert for the blacklist `tokenId`.
