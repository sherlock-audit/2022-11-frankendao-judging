# Usage of function signature for proposal will not work for all cases. Function with different name can have same signature

## Summary
During proposal creation, [signature ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L367)argument is used. 

From the [comment ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L360)it can be understood as this is function signature.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L357-L370

For proposal creation, `_signatures` is used. The natspec comment say, it is function signature.

In solidity, function signature mean, first four bytes when hashing the function name with argument type.

It is possible, two different function name with argument can  have same signature.

## Impact

Proposals can not be created even when function names are different.
Proposals can clash as per code.

## Recommendation

Kindly rethink of using the function signature for proposal.
