# The total community voting power can be huge because of incorrect conditions.

## Summary
When a user stakes tokens to get voting power, if the user just unlocked their community voting power, the total community voting power is updated using `_updateTotalCommunityVotingPower`. But the if statement lacks of conditions, so the update of total community voting power is not correct.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    // If the user had no tokenVotingPower before and doesn't delegate, they just unlocked their community voting power
    // If their tokenVotingPower == newVotingPower, that means (a) it was 0 before and (b) they don't delegate, or it'd be 0 now
    if (tokenVotingPower[msg.sender] == newVotingPower) {
      // The user's community voting power is reactivated, so we add it to the total community voting power
      _updateTotalCommunityVotingPower(msg.sender, true);
    
    // If their delegate had no tokenVotingPower before, then they just unlocked their community voting power
    } else if (tokenVotingPower[getDelegate(msg.sender)] == newVotingPower) {
      // The delegate's community voting power is reactivated, so we add it to the total community voting power
      _updateTotalCommunityVotingPower(getDelegate(msg.sender), true);
    }
```

The if conditionals are incorrect. The first update assumes that `msg.sender` didn't delegate, but the `tokenVotingPower[msg.sender] == newVotingPower` can be met when `msg.sender` already delegated and being delegated by another.

Also in the case, the second update is not executed because the first condition is met already. As a result, the total community voting is not correct after update.

Fortunately, the same condition of `_unstake` function is correct.

## Impact
The total community voting power can be increased without limit due to this vulnerability.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add more conditions to check if the msg.sender delegated or not.

```solidity
    if(msg.sender == getDelegate(msg.sender)){
        if (tokenVotingPower[msg.sender] == newVotingPower) {
            _updateTotalCommunityVotingPower(msg.sender, true);
        }
    } else {
        if (tokenVotingPower[getDelegate(msg.sender)] == newVotingPower) {
          _updateTotalCommunityVotingPower(getDelegate(msg.sender), true);
        }
    }
```
