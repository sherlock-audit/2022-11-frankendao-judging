# User can get much more voting power than he/she should

## Summary
When staking, there is no input validation on `_unlockTime` so any user could send in an extremely high value and get an absurd voting power.
## Vulnerability Detail
The intended behaviour, if we look at the documentation and the comment when setting the staking bonus parameters in the constructor:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L206-L210
Is that the bonus when a user stakes his/her tokens goes from 0 to 20. The user would get at the end of the maximun of 4 weeks of staking 20 votes of bonus.
But for each token the user stakes, there is a call to function `_stakeToken` which does the following:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L390-L394
Under my point of view, these snippet should either:
* Require that `_unlockTime` is not greater than `block.timstamp + stakingSettings.maxStakeBonusTime`
* Check that `_unlockTime` is not greater than `block.timstamp + stakingSettings.maxStakeBonusTime` and if it is, calculate `fullStakedTimeBonus` using `block.timstamp + stakingSettings.maxStakeBonusTime` instead of `_unlockTime`

This last option has the downside that if the user enters a very big `_unlockTime` the tokens will remain locked in the contract until that time arrives.


## Impact
A single user could manipulate his/her voting power to make any malicious proposal pass.

## Code Snippet
The following Forge test show how a user can get an enormous voting power by feeding a very large `_unlockTime` to the `stake` function. This test can be added to the [Staking.t.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/test/staking/Staking.t.sol) file.
```solidity
function testIssueUnlockTime() public {
	address owner = frankenpunks.ownerOf(PUNK_ID);

	vm.startPrank(owner);
	frankenpunks.approve(address(staking), PUNK_ID);

	uint[] memory ids = new uint[](1);
	ids[0] = PUNK_ID;

	// set an very big unlock time that doesn't make the test to revert
	uint attackUnlockTime = type(uint256).max/20;

	// call stake
	staking.stake(ids, attackUnlockTime);
	uint votingPower = staking.getTokenVotingPower(PUNK_ID);
	uint votes = staking.getVotes(owner);

	// We check that both the voting power of the token and the total votes of the owner
	// are a super big number
	assertEq(votingPower, 47863793500874750092415255046580649740935013502662270188267850532357727);
	assertEq(votes, 47863793500874750092415255046580649740935013502662270188267850532357727);
}
```

## Tool used

Forge tests and manual Review

## Recommendation
Fix the calculation of the staking bonus to revert if the `unlockTime` is greater that 4 weeks (stakingSettings.maxStakeBonusAmount) in the future.
```solidity
if (_unlockTime > 0) {
	require(_unlockTime <= block.timestamp + stakingSettings.maxStakeBonusTime);
	unlockTime[_tokenId] = _unlockTime;
	uint fullStakedTimeBonus = ((_unlockTime - block.timestamp) * stakingSettings.maxStakeBonusAmount) / stakingSettings.maxStakeBonusTime;
	stakedTimeBonus[_tokenId] = _tokenId < 10000 ? fullStakedTimeBonus : fullStakedTimeBonus / 2;
}
```
