# Users can receive a fullStakedTimeBonus higher than maxStakeBonusAmount.

## Summary

A user is able to submit a large _unlockTime in Staking.stake() and receive a much higher fullStakedTimeBonus then the cap of maxStakeBonusAmount.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. A user could call Staking.stake() with an _unlockTime of ((max(uint256) / maxStakeBonusAmount) + current current block.timestamp).
2. The calculation on [Line 392](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L392) will result in them having a very large fullStakedTimeBonus saved to stakedTimeBonus[_tokenId].
3. When a tokens voting power is calculated in getTokenVotingPower() stakedTimeBonus[_tokenId] will have a much larger influence on the results than it should if it was restricted to the cap. (default is 20)

## Impact

A user will receive a much larger voting power then they should be able to and can unfairly influence the outcomes of any proposals.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a line in stakeToken after fullStakedTimeBonus is calculated:
```solidity
fullStakedTimeBonus = fullStakedTimeBonus > maxStakeBonusAmount ? maxStakeBonusAmount : fullStakedTimeBonus;
```
or restrict _unlockTime to being a max of 4 weeks after current block.timestamp.
