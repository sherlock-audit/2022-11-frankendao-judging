# User can gain near maximum votes

## Summary
There is no check on `_unlockTime` in stake function. User can specify a value that is astromically large. This causes them to gain near maximum votes.
## Vulnerability Detail
No checks on `_unlockTime` for `stake` can enable a user to put `(maximum 
 uint256)/stakingSettings.maxStakeBonusAmount` as the _unlockTime and give them near maximum votes by the fullStakedTimeBonus calculation.

```solidity
 if (_unlockTime > 0) {
      unlockTime[_tokenId] = _unlockTime;
      uint fullStakedTimeBonus = ((_unlockTime - block.timestamp) * stakingSettings.maxStakeBonusAmount) / stakingSettings.maxStakeBonusTime;
      stakedTimeBonus[_tokenId] = _tokenId < 10000 ? fullStakedTimeBonus : fullStakedTimeBonus / 2;
    }
```
### POS

Test code placed in Staking.t.sol and run `forge test   --match test_UserCanGainMaximumVotes -vvv`

```solidity

function test_UserCanGainMaximumVotes() public {

        //address owner = _mockStakeSingle(PUNK_ID, 5789604461865809771178549250434395392663499233282028201972879200395656481996);

        (uint maxStakeBonusTime, uint maxStakeBonusAmount) = staking.stakingSettings();

        address owner = _mockStakeSingle(PUNK_ID, type(uint256).max / maxStakeBonusAmount); //staking.stake(PUNK_ID, _unlockTime)

        emit log_string("User votes: ");
        emit log_uint(staking.getVotes(owner));

}


```
User can gain near maximum votes. Note that user can calculate the most optimal near maximum vote by using `staking.stakingSettings` values and calculating it till it reaches near `uint24` max as votes are casted to uint24

```solidity
        // Calculate the number of votes a user is able to cast
        // This takes into account delegation and community voting power
        uint24 votes = (staking.getVotes(_voter)).toUint24();
```

## Impact
User can gain near maximum votes.

## Recommendation
Check `_unlockTime` in `stake()` for sane inputs. E.g `require(block.timestamp - _unlockTime <=  (5 years))`
