# `_target` parameter not checked in `Executeor.sol::executeTransaction`

## Summary
`_target` parameter not checked in `Executeor.sol::executeTransaction`.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no check if `_target` is a contract address or not in `Executeor.sol::executeTransaction`. If `_target` is an EOA, a low level call to it always execute successfully, thus a queued proposal unexpectedly set an EOA as '_target`, the proposal seems executed successfully but have no effect.

## Impact
The proposal seems executed successfully but have no effect.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Executor.sol#L136
```solidity
        (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = _target.call{ value: _value }(_data); // @audit-issue `_target` not checked.
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if `_target` is a contract  in `Executeor.sol::executeTransaction`.
