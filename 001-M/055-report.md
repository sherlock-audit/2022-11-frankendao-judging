# Using `ERC721.transferFrom()` instead of `safeTransferFrom()` may cause the user's NFT to be frozen in a contract that does not support ERC721

## Summary

There are certain smart contracts that do not support ERC721, using `transferFrom()` may result in the NFT being sent to such contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `unstake()`, `_to` is param from user's input.

However, if `_to` is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in that contract.

As per the documentation of EIP-721:

> A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.

## Impact

The NFT may get stuck in the contract that does support ERC721.
