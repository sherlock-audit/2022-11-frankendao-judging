# Executor can't handle 2 tx with same data in one proposal

## Summary
Executor can't handle 2 tx with same data in one proposal.
## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function queueTransaction(
        address _target,
        uint256 _value,
        string memory _signature,
        bytes memory _data,
        uint256 _eta
    ) public onlyGovernance returns (bytes32 txHash) {
        if (block.timestamp + DELAY > _eta) revert DelayNotSatisfied();


        txHash = keccak256(abi.encode(_target, _value, _signature, _data, _eta));
        if (queuedTransactions[txHash]) revert IdenticalTransactionAlreadyQueued();
        queuedTransactions[txHash] = true;


        emit QueueTransaction(txHash, _target, _value, _signature, _data, _eta);
    }
```
Currently Executor can't handle proposal with 2 equal tx. But it's possible that they will need that.
This submission is more like recommendation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You can have field `transactionId` in Executor. Each time new tx is queued it should be increased and returned to the msg.sender. Transaction hash should also include this transactionId. On Governance side, you need to store returned transactionId for each tx. For example to have one more array with transaction ids. Then when you need for example execute tx, you provide all execute data(as it is now) + transactionId.
In such way you don't have problems with duplicates.
