# Unstaking gas price will be very high when too many active proposals.

## Summary
Users who wants to unstake when there is a lot of active proposals will pay really big gas price as protocol doesn't refund gas for unstaking.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L166-L174
```solidity
  modifier lockedWhileVotesCast() {
    uint[] memory activeProposals = governance.getActiveProposals();
    for (uint i = 0; i < activeProposals.length; i++) {
      if (governance.getReceipt(activeProposals[i], getDelegate(msg.sender)).hasVoted) revert TokenLocked();
      (, address proposer,) = governance.getProposalData(activeProposals[i]);
      if (proposer == getDelegate(msg.sender)) revert TokenLocked();
    }
    _;
  }
```
Staking.lockedWhileVotesCast modifier is used for delegation and unstaking. The main purpose is to not allow to unstake or delegate once your votes are using is in any active proposal.
This modifier depends on how many active proposals are in Governance. First, it makes one call to Governance to get all active proposals. Then for each active proposal it will make 2 more calls to Governance.

Function Staking.unstake [allows](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L420-L458) to unstake token. It uses lockedWhileVotesCast modifier and is not refundable.
For unstaking the gas price for the msg.sender whose votes are not used by any active proposal increases by the amount of active proposals. As unstaking is not refundable, so user should pay gas price himself.
## Impact
User pays too much for a gas, when unstaking with big amount of active proposals.

## Recommendation
As unstaking depends on active proposals i guess you should refund this operation also.
