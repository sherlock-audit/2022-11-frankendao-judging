# Unstaking and delegation can be not possible to use if too many active proposals exists.

## Summary
If Governance has many active proposals, then it will be not possible to unstake and delegate for users of protocol, because Staking.lockedWhileVotesCast modifier will fail with block gas limit. 
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L166-L174
```solidity
  modifier lockedWhileVotesCast() {
    uint[] memory activeProposals = governance.getActiveProposals();
    for (uint i = 0; i < activeProposals.length; i++) {
      if (governance.getReceipt(activeProposals[i], getDelegate(msg.sender)).hasVoted) revert TokenLocked();
      (, address proposer,) = governance.getProposalData(activeProposals[i]);
      if (proposer == getDelegate(msg.sender)) revert TokenLocked();
    }
    _;
  }
```
Staking.lockedWhileVotesCast modifier is used for delegation and unstaking. The main purpose is to not allow to unstake or delegate once your votes are using is in any active proposal.

This modifier depends on how many active proposals are in Governance. First, it makes one call to Governance to get all active proposals. Then for each active proposal it will make 2 more calls to Governance. In case when we have big amount of proposals we will revert because of block gas limit. This will block ability of users to unstake and delegate even if their votes are not in use by any active proposal. They will need to wait once some proposals will be executed.
 
## Impact
Unstaking and delegation can be blocked.

## Recommendation
Consider to have some limit on amount of active proposals in Governance.
