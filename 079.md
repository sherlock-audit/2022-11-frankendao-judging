# User can transfer voting power

## Summary
There is no minimum unlock delay which means user can plan there stake and unstake. This means user can send there tokens to another address which can revote as shown in POC

## Vulnerability Detail
1. User A stakes token ids T1 for unlock period of 1 second
2. User A votes on proposal and then unstakes post 1 second
3. User A transfers this token to his another address B
4. Address B stakes same token ids T1 for unlock period of 1 second 
5. Address B votes on proposal and then unstakes post 1 second
6. Repeat this process to get unlimited voting power

## Impact
Same tokens can be used to make multiple votes in a proposal
