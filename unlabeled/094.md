# Use safeTransferFrom instead of transferFrom

## Summary

Tokens transferred out of the contract during unstaking will be lost if the receiver does not support ERC721

## Vulnerability Detail

In `Staking#_unstakeToken` the token is transferred to the `to` address during unstaking. If the `to` address does not support ERC721, the tokens will be stuck in the contract

## Impact

The transferred token cannot be transferred from the contract 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
477    collection.transferFrom(address(this), _to, _tokenId);  
```

## Recommendation
