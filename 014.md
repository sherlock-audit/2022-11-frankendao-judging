# User with delegated votes in amount more then proposalThreshold can block his delegator for undelegating votes

## Summary
User with delegated votes in amount more then proposalThreshold can block his delegator for undelegating votes.
## Vulnerability Detail
Function Staking.delegate [is used](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Staking.sol#L269-L316) to delegate your votes to someone else. Once you did it, delegatee can use your votes. You can easily undelegate votes to yourself or to someone else when this votes are not used in any active proposal. This is checked with `lockedWhileVotesCast` modifier. So if you delegated someone your votes and he used them on any ongoing proposal, you can't undelegate votes back.

This creates a possibility for delegatee to never give back delegated votes.
He can create new proposal every time when the previous one was canceled if he has amount of votes more than proposalThreshold. He should do such thing once in `votingDelay + votingPeriod` amount of time.
Note, that proposal can create new proposal, when the last one is [not active or pending](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L386-L392) anymore.

Also in such way attacker can block delegator from unstaking his token.
## Impact
User can block delegator to undelegate votes

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe it's needed to have some small cooldown period, after the last user's proposal was canceled.
