# Condition can be combined

## Summary

If condition in `_stake` to update community voting power can be combined to a single if statement

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    // If the user had no tokenVotingPower before and doesn't delegate, they just unlocked their community voting power
    // If their tokenVotingPower == newVotingPower, that means (a) it was 0 before and (b) they don't delegate, or it'd be 0 now
    if (tokenVotingPower[msg.sender] == newVotingPower) {
      // The user's community voting power is reactivated, so we add it to the total community voting power
      _updateTotalCommunityVotingPower(msg.sender, true);
    
    // If their delegate had no tokenVotingPower before, then they just unlocked their community voting power
    } else if (tokenVotingPower[getDelegate(msg.sender)] == newVotingPower) { 
      // The delegate's community voting power is reactivated, so we add it to the total community voting power
      _updateTotalCommunityVotingPower(getDelegate(msg.sender), true);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Combine to a single if statement, if a user has no delegate it returns msg.sender

```solidity
    if (tokenVotingPower[getDelegate(msg.sender)] == newVotingPower) { 
      _updateTotalCommunityVotingPower(getDelegate(msg.sender), true);
    }
```
