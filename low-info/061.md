# [Low-1] Due to lock on actions of delegator, if the delegatee has participated in active proposals, the delegatee can stop its delegators from changing their delegation or doing unstake

## Summary
Due to lock on actions of delegator, if the delegatee has participated in active proposals, the delegatee can stop its delegators from changing their delegation or doing unstake.

## Vulnerability Detail
To avoid the need to do checkpoints, FrakenDAO locks the userâ€™s tokens and their actions if they themselves have participated or if their delegatees have participated.
The issue with the second condition is this may stop delegators from changing their stance even if they want to.

Any given delegatee can keep proposing continuously or keep voting to keep its delegators on hold.

Even if we consider that the given delegatee doesn't have any malicious intent, if governance is very active, it won't allow users to change their delegation or do an unstake in the best case as well.

This is a protocol-level decision, hence one may argue it's expected. 
Please downgrade this if you are okay with this risk.

## Impact: Medium
Users not being able to re-delegate or unstake.

## Likelihood: Low
