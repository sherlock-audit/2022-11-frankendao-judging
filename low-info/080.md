# [Informational-1] One can delegate to 0XFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF and cause getTotalVotingPower to consider total community voting power instead of user’s own community power

## Summary
One can delegate to 0XFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF and cause getTotalVotingPower to consider total community voting power instead of the user’s own community power

## Vulnerability Detail
`getCommunityVotingPower()` returns total community voting power instead of the user’s community voting power if the passed address is `address(type(uint160).max)`.
```solidity
function getCommunityVotingPower(address _voter) public override view returns (uint) {
      uint64 votes;
      uint64 proposalsCreated;
      uint64 proposalsPassed;
      
      // We allow this function to be called with the max uint value to get the total community voting power
      if (_voter == address(type(uint160).max)) { 
        (votes, proposalsCreated, proposalsPassed) = governance.totalCommunityScoreData();
      } else {
        // This is only the case if they are delegated or unstaked, both of which should zero out the result
        if (tokenVotingPower[_voter] == 0) return 0;

        (votes, proposalsCreated, proposalsPassed) = governance.userCommunityScoreData(_voter);
      }

```
This would have been okay in itself, but the issue is one can delegate to `address(type(uint160).max)` as well even if that address doesn't have voting power.
Making ``getTotalVotingPower``to return the wrong value for the `address(type(uint160).max)`.
A huge value instead of Zero.

Though it's not impacting since `address(type(uint160).max)` can not participate, consider correcting this by ideally using something different to differentiate between total and user-specific community voting power.
## Impact: Low
Incorrect data representation.
