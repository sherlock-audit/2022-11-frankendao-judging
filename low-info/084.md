# stakeToken() doesn't provide enough checks for arbitrary nft input, missing checks for the collection

## Summary

Staking contracts provide only checks on the tokenId, not on the collection

## Vulnerability Detail

In the staking contract the internal function _staketoken() checks only for tokenId's

## Impact

Allowing arbitrary staking of any nft, thereby rendering the staking contract inefficient where a malicious user could hijack proposals

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

add a check prior to the stakeToken() function the makes sure that the nft provided is from FrankenPunks/FrankenMonsters rather than assuming the id given should match either or, given a third option means it's neither it could revert
