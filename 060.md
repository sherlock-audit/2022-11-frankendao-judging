# [High-2] Total voting power and thereby quorum would be calculated incorrectly due to missing updates for total community voting power in the delegation edge case.

## Summary
Total voting power and thereby quorum would be calculated incorrectly due to missing updates for total community voting power in the delegation edge case

## Vulnerability Detail
Frakendao incentivizes community participation in governance by allocating more votes to active users.

Since quorum calculation needs total voting power, one needs to also keep track of this total community voting power.

```solidity
function getTotalVotingPower() public view returns (uint) {
      return totalTokenVotingPower + getCommunityVotingPower(address(type(uint160).max));
    }
```

This total community voting power changes as per user choices inside stake, unstake and delegation.
**If we consider delegations the `update` cases are as follows.** 

```solidity
// If a user is delegating back to themselves, they regain their community voting power, so adjust totals up
    if (_delegator == _delegatee) {
      _updateTotalCommunityVotingPower(_delegator, true);

    // If a user delegates away their votes, they forfeit their community voting power, so adjust totals down
    } else if (currentDelegate == _delegator) {
      _updateTotalCommunityVotingPower(_delegator, false);
    }
```

if we simplify it is 

**case 1:** a delegation from self to someone: decrease in comm voting power

**case 2:** a delegation from someone to someone: no need to update comm voting power

**case 3:** a delegation from someone to self: increase in comm voting power

the one case missed here is when the next “someone” did not have any voting power presently but has participated in the past and just got it delegated

**Rule: Community voting power for a user is considered only if they have token voting power.**

And in this case, someone now does own the token voting power, and `getCommunityVotingPower` would also add the community voting power for them, but the total won't reflect it, disturbing quorum calculation.
**If we check the stake, this missed case of delegation is considered there,**

## Impact: High
This impacts quorum, hence directly affecting governance.
In the worst case, it may allow the proposal to pass when the actual quorum is not yet reached.

## Likelihood: Medium 
This needs a special case to occur, so not high IMO. But anyone can trigger it so not Low as well.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the required case in the delegation as well, similar to the stake.
