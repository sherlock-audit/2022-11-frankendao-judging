# Voters can increase their community voting power without any token voting power using `castVote()`.

## Summary
Voters can increase their community voting power without any token voting power using `castVote()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, the voters can increase their community voting power when they vote on an active proposal using `castVote()` and it updates `CommunityScoreData.votes` in [_castVote](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L620-L643) like below.

```solidity
    // Calculate the number of votes a user can cast
    // This takes into account delegation and community voting power
    uint24 votes = (staking.getVotes(_voter)).toUint24(); //@audit votes = 0

    // Update the proposal's total voting records based on the votes
    if (_support == 0) {
        proposal.againstVotes = proposal.againstVotes + votes;
    } else if (_support == 1) {
        proposal.forVotes = proposal.forVotes + votes;
    } else if (_support == 2) {
        proposal.abstainVotes = proposal.abstainVotes + votes;
    }

    // Update the user's receipt for this proposal
    receipt.hasVoted = true;
    receipt.support = _support;
    receipt.votes = votes;

    // Make these updates after the vote so it doesn't impact voting power for this vote.
    ++totalCommunityScoreData.votes;

    // We can update the total community voting power with no check because if you can vote, 
    // it means you have votes so you haven't delegated.
    ++userCommunityScoreData[_voter].votes;
```

But it doesn't check if `votes == 0` properly so that any voters without any token voting power can cast a vote and earn community voting power.

It's not a behavior that the protocol wants and we should prevent the votes of 0 amount.

## Impact
`totalCommunityScoreData.votes` might be inflated because any voter can cast a vote and earn community voting power without any token voting power.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
We should check if `votes > 0` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L622).

```solidity
    // Calculate the number of votes a user can cast
    // This takes into account delegation and community voting power
    uint24 votes = (staking.getVotes(_voter)).toUint24();

    require(votes > 0, "no voting power");
```
