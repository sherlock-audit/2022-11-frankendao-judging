# Voting power can be incorrectly calculated due to wrong variable being incremented.

## Summary

The variable proposalsCreated is incorrectly incremented in Governance.queue() instead of proposalsPassed.

## Vulnerability Detail

Due to the wrong variable being incremented in Governance.queue() the return value from the calculation in Staking.getCommunityVotingPower() may be incorrect. If a user creates a proposal that is passed it would be expected that their proposalsCreated value would equal 200 &  their proposalsPassed value would also equal 200, however with the current implementation proposalsCreated will equal 400 & proposalsPassed will equal 0.

## Impact

With the default values being equal for proposalsPassed & proposalsCreated there is currently no impact on a users votingPower, there is just incorrect accounting as the variables do not reflect what their true values should be.  

However there could be an impact in the future if the values of either proposalsPassed or proposalsCreated are changed. i.e. admins decide to give a higher weighting to proposalsPassed and change its value to 400, users will receive less voting power than they should.
