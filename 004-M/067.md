# `Governance.queue()` should update the `CommunityScoreData.proposalsPassed` instead of `CommunityScoreData.proposalsCreated`.

## Summary
`Governance.queue()` should update the `CommunityScoreData.proposalsPassed` instead of `CommunityScoreData.proposalsCreated`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In [Governance.queue()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L484-L489), `CommunityScoreData.proposalsCreated` is increased by 1 for the community voting power.

```solidity
    // If a proposal is queued, we are ready to award the community voting power bonuses to the proposer
    ++userCommunityScoreData[proposal.proposer].proposalsCreated;
    
    // We don't need to check whether the proposer is accruing community voting power because
    // they needed that voting power to propose, and once they have an Active Proposal, their
    // tokens are locked from delegating and unstaking.
    ++totalCommunityScoreData.proposalsCreated;
```

But the same logic is implemented in [verifyProposal()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L452-L458) and `CommunityScoreData.proposalsPassed` should be increased in the `queue()` function.

```solidity
    // If a proposal was valid, we are ready to award the community voting power bonuses to the proposer
    ++userCommunityScoreData[proposal.proposer].proposalsCreated;
    
    // We don't need to check whether the proposer is accruing community voting power because
    // they needed that voting power to propose, and once they have an Active Proposal, their
    // tokens are locked from delegating and unstaking.
    ++totalCommunityScoreData.proposalsCreated;
```

## Impact
It doesn't calculate the `CommunityScoreData.proposalsPassed` properly and it will be always 0.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
We should modify `queue()` like below.

```solidity
    // If a proposal is queued, we are ready to award the community voting power bonuses to the proposer
    ++userCommunityScoreData[proposal.proposer].proposalsPassed; //+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    
    // We don't need to check whether the proposer is accruing community voting power because
    // they needed that voting power to propose, and once they have an Active Proposal, their
    // tokens are locked from delegating and unstaking.
    ++totalCommunityScoreData.proposalsPassed; //+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
```
