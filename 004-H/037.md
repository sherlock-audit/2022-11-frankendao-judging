# Wrong update of community power when a proposal is queued

## Summary
When a proposal is queued, the value of `userCommunityScoreData[proposal.propser].proposalsCreated` is increased by 1, but it should update the value of `userCommunityScoreData[proposal.propser].proposalsPassed` instead. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The community power of a user is divided into 3 parameters as follows: 
```solidity=
struct CommunityScoreData {
    uint64 votes; // [#explain] number of time a user vote a proposal 
    uint64 proposalsCreated; // [#explain] number of time a user creates a proposal successfully 
    uint64 proposalsPassed; // [#explain] number of time a proposal of user is queued successfully 
}
```
Following the purpose of each parameter I explain in the code above, when a proposal is queued, it should increase the value of `proposalPassed` by 1. But in the function `Governance.queue()` it updates the value of `proposalCreated` which is a wrong implementation. 

## Impact
Wrong calculation of voting power for users (This can happen when `communityPowerMultipliers.proposalsCreated != communityPowerMultipliers.proposalsPassed`)

## Tool used
Manual review 

## Recommendation
Change function `Governance.queue()` as follow: 
```solidity=
function queue(uint256 _proposalId) external {
    // Succeeded means we're past the endTime, yes votes outweigh no votes, and quorum threshold is met
    if(state(_proposalId) != ProposalState.Succeeded) revert InvalidStatus();

    Proposal storage proposal = proposals[_proposalId];

    // Set the ETA (time for execution) to the soonest time based on the Executor's delay
    uint256 eta = block.timestamp + executor.DELAY();
    proposal.eta = eta.toUint32();

    // Queue separate transactions for each action in the proposal
    uint numTargets = proposal.targets.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < numTargets; i++) {
        executor.queueTransaction(proposal.targets[i], proposal.values[i], proposal.signatures[i], proposal.calldatas[i], eta);
    }
 
    // If a proposal is queued, we are ready to award the community voting power bonuses to the proposer
    
    /// [!note] change here 
    ++userCommunityScoreData[proposal.proposer].proposalsPassed;

    // We don't need to check whether the proposer is accruing community voting power because
    // they needed that voting power to propose, and once they have an Active Proposal, their
    // tokens are locked from delegating and unstaking
    
    /// [!note] change here 
    ++totalCommunityScoreData.proposalsPassed;

    // Remove the proposal from the Active Proposals array
    _removeFromActiveProposals(_proposalId);

    emit ProposalQueued(_proposalId, eta);
}
```
