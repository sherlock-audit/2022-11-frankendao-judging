# When a proposal is passed proposalsCreated is incremented instead of proposalsPassed

## Summary
Function `queue` increments incorrectly `proposalsCreated`, both total and those of the proposer instead of `proposalsPassed`. In fact, `proposalsPassed` is never incremented in the code.
## Vulnerability Detail
Both total and proposer's `proposalsCreated` are incremented everytime a proposal is verified by the admins (see lines 453 and 458 below).
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L445-L459
This is the only place where they should be incremented, because it should count only once per proposal towards voting power.
But function `queue` increments also this value:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/src/Governance.sol#L467-L495
In lines 484 and 489, the value incremented should be `proposalsPassed` instead of `proposalsCreated` because the proposal in this function is in state SUCEEDED and is ready to go inside the execution queue, and hence it's considered passed.
## Impact
Since the multipliers for both `proposalsCreated` and `proposalsPassed` are set to 200 in the constructor, the impact would only be noticeable once they are not equal by calling either `setProposalsCreatedMultiplier` or `setProposalsPassedMultiplier` with a value different than 200. In this case, the impact would be high because que community votes calculated for each user and the total community votes would be wrong.
## Code Snippet
The following test, which can be included inside [ProposalState.t.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-frankendao/blob/main/test/governance/ProposalState.t.sol), shows how `proposalsCreated` is incremented instead of `proposalsPassed`.
```solidity
function testIssueProposalsPassed() public {

	address owner = frankenpunks.ownerOf(PUNK_ID);

	(uint64 v, uint64 pc, uint64 pp) = gov.totalCommunityScoreData();
	// both total proposalsCreated and total proposalsPassed are 0 initially
	assertEq(pc, 0);
	assertEq(pp, 0);

	(v, pc, pp) = gov.userCommunityScoreData(proposer);
	// both proposer's proposalsCreated and proposer's proposalsPassed are 0 initially
	assertEq(pc, 0);
	assertEq(pp, 0);


	// the proposer creates a proposal
	uint proposalId = _createAndVerifyProposal();

	// after creating the proposal, total proposalsCreated is 1 and total proposalsPassed is 0
	(v, pc, pp) = gov.totalCommunityScoreData();
	assertEq(pc, 1);
	assertEq(pp, 0);
	// after creating the proposal, proposer's proposalsCreated is 1 and proposer's proposalsPassed is 0
	(v, pc, pp) = gov.userCommunityScoreData(proposer);
	assertEq(pc, 1);
	assertEq(pp, 0);

	// the proposal is voted upon and queued (it should be now a 'passed' proposal) 
	vm.warp(block.timestamp + gov.votingDelay());
	_vote(proposalId, 1, true); // voter votes for proposal
	vm.warp(block.timestamp + gov.votingPeriod() + 1);
	vm.prank(stranger);
	gov.queue(proposalId);

	// after passing the proposal, total proposalsCreated is 2 and total proposalsPassed is 0
	// it should be proposalsCreated = 1 and proposalsPassed = 1
	(v, pc, pp) = gov.totalCommunityScoreData();
	assertEq(pc, 2);
	assertEq(pp, 0);
	// after passing the proposal, proposer's proposalsCreated is 2 and proposer's proposalsPassed is 0
	// it should be proposalsCreated = 1 and proposalsPassed = 1
	(v, pc, pp) = gov.userCommunityScoreData(proposer);
	assertEq(pc, 2);
	assertEq(pp, 0);
}
