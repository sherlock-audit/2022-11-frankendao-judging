# Functions that change community vote multipiers will affect quorum for open proposals

## Summary

Staking#setVotesMultiplier, setProposalsCreatedMultipiers and setProposalsPassedMultipliers allows community voting parameters to be changed. If it is changed after there are already users staked, the voting system and vote count will be irreversibly damaged.

## Vulnerability Detail

    function _updateTotalCommunityVotingPower(address _delegator, bool _increase) internal {
      (uint64 votes, uint64 proposalsCreated, uint64 proposalsPassed) = governance.userCommunityScoreData(_delegator);
      (uint64 totalVotes, uint64 totalProposalsCreated, uint64 totalProposalsPassed) = governance.totalCommunityScoreData();

      if (_increase) {
        governance.updateTotalCommunityScoreData(totalVotes + votes, totalProposalsCreated + proposalsCreated, totalProposalsPassed + proposalsPassed);
      } else {
        governance.updateTotalCommunityScoreData(totalVotes - votes, totalProposalsCreated - proposalsCreated, totalProposalsPassed - proposalsPassed);
      }
    }

_updateTotalCommunityVotingPower adjusts both the user's votes and the total number of votes outstanding. It is called each time a user delegates or unstakes, and always uses the most current value for the community voting power. Staking#setVotesMultiplier, setProposalsCreatedMultipiers and setProposalsPassedMultipliers allows these multipliers to be changed. When proposals are created their quorum is set based on the current voting power. Changes to the multiplies will influence the total votes skewing the total number of votes from quorum.

Example:
Assume there are 1000 votes and quorum of 20%. A proposal is opened meaning that it's quorum is 200 votes. Now a community multiplier is changed and the total number of votes increases to 1200. Now the quorum is only ~16% vs the desired 20%. This allows proposals to pass that otherwise wouldn't have.

This could be abused by adversaries to open proposals on purpose before changes go into effect to allow them to pass proposals.

## Impact

Quorum will be skewed for open proposals when community vote multipliers are changed.

## Recommendation

Changing community multipliers should cancel all open proposals
