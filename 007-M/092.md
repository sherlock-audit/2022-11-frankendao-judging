# Ether can be burned by an attacker by submitting a proposal with a large string

## Summary

A malicious actor could burn Ether by creating a proposal with a large `_description` string. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol allows for refundable proposals to be made with no upper cap on refunds. An event is emitted on line 425 in the Governance.sol contract in the `_deposit` function which is part of the code that is refundable, called on line 349. The only limit to the size of the calldata is the block gas limit of 30 million. 

A similar issue was found in a previous Nouns DAO audit in the refunding of votes functionality, FrankenDAO has mitigated that issue by removing the reason string in the voting functionality but has reintroduced a similar issue to the `propose` function. 

## Impact

FrankenDAO has written about the potential of funds being wasted in the refunding functionality. I believe they overlooked a few issues. Here is their reasoning:

"Although no user can earn money through refunds, a malicious user could abuse this functionality waste funds. For this reason, we've implemented a cap on 1 refund per day for staking and delegating. There is no cap on proposing or voting because (a) proposing requires having a large % of FrankenPunks, and we don't believe a major holder would want to waste treasury funds and (b) users can only vote once per proposal, so voting can't be abused."

An attacker could waste the entire pool for refunds in a single proposal and they could potentially do it without having to "own" a FrankenPunks. There are protocols that offer collateralized renting of NFTs such as reNFT and Vera, by using such a service an attacker could rent Franken NFTs for a few weeks, stake them and earn enough votes to drain the refunding pool and finally unstake and return the Franken NFT to unlock their collateral. 

The burning of funds would cost the attacker roughly as much as they waste since they will have to pay for the additional transaction overhead of the massive calldata usage. Calldata costs has been reduced before (EIP 2028) and is expected to be reduced significantly in the future (EIP 4488). This would lower the cost of the attack by a large amount.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I recommend that an upper limit to the amount of gas that can refunded is added. Nouns DAO has added a 200.000 gas limit to their refunding of votes.
